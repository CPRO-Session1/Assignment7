1:
++*p:advances the pointer one space in the array in memory, than checks what is in that spot.
*p++: checks the space in memory at that spot, then advances one space.
*++p" does the same as the first, because the placement of the '++' makes the difference, not the '*'

2:
Left to right garuntees operator precedence.

3:
Using pointers allows you to more easily look through lists and access things in memory than having to reference them directly.

4:
int *p=12
*p=2
char
