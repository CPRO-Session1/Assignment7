Part 2 of Assignment7

1) ++*p increments the value of a pointer, and *p++ increments the address of a pointer. *++p is not valid, as it is incrementing invalidly.

2) Left to right order is guaranteed for operator precedence; without this, many operators become essentially useless, because the logic of the code would not be reliable.

3) Pointers are passed by reference allowing for multiple return types. Additionally, constant pointers can be made; additionally, arrays of pointers allow for non-standard char arrays that are of varying size. They can also be used to return an array of values.

4) a[0] = 11
a[1] = 11
a[2] = 12
a[3] = 13
a[4] = 14
a[5] = 15
a[6] = 16
a[7] = 17
a[8] = 18
a[9] = 19
p = 12
char *varname[]
4.1 char[]
4.2 would subtract ascii values, resulting in value 1, or SOH
4.3 Valid, changes a char
4.4 Pointer
4.5 Returns the address of the beginning of the array
4.6 Returns the value that said pointer points to
4.7 Returns the address of a pointer
4.8 Increments the address of the pointer
4.9 Gets the address of the variable
4.10 Returns an integer length of the space in memory
