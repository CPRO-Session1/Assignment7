1. First one means, ++(*p) adds one before implementing pointer. Second one is (*P++), but precedence of ++ is treated before P. Last one is similar to the second one, but it is treated as (*++P) where the compiler looks for associativity.
2. I think both do not guarentee operator precedence, this is because in postfix, &&, ||, mathematical functions, comparison, the computer code reads it from left to right. However, for conditions, assignment of variables, and prefixes, the code goes from right to left. 
3. Advantages of pointers are when handling arrays, and data tables. They allow references to functions, and can return multiple variables and values.
4. I am a bit clueless on number 4 and would like some explanation. Thanks.
