1.
The difference between ++*P, *p++ and *++p is that:
++*P increases the value of *p by one
*p++ moves up the location of the pointer by one
*++p will do exactly what ++*p does

2. 
Yes, the order is guaranteed

3.
For fuction parameters
for dynamic programming
Pointer enables you to do things that are otherwise impossible, it also speeds up the operation

4.
4.1 invalid because b and c are undeclared.
4.2 invalid because of undeclared variables.
4.3 I am not sure what this means.
4.4 10 because the pointer of a string prints the first number.
4.5 10 because a[0] = 10.
4.6 12 because a = 10 and *p = a + 2.
4.7 invalid because p has not been declared although *p is.
4.8 ello because argv *argv is moved up one location it will not print the h.
4.9 I am not sure what this will output.
4.10 10 because that is the size of the string.
