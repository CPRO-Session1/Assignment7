1. For an array {1, 2, 3, 4}
	a. ++*p will get the variable located at *p then increment it. if *p is at index 0, new array would be {2, 2, 3, 4} with *p at index 0
	b. *p++ will increment p (move the index forward once), then get the value of it. If *p is at index 0, then the array will be {1,2,3,4} with *p at index 1
	c. *++p is equivalent to *p++ as the prefix ++ and * evaluate right to left.
2. No, it depends on the type of operator.
3. Pointers are used for functions that need to actually change their arguments or for returning an array of values
