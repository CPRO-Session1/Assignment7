1. ++*p reads right to left. Therefore, it increments point p.  Same with *++p, the order of operation is right to left. But point p is incremented then the dereferenced. *p++ is read left to right therefore it is incremented then dereferenced. 

2. No the order of precedence is not guaranteed

3. advantages:
- it points to a specific lovation in memory
- provides direct access to memory
- reduces storage and complexity
