1. Explain the difference between ++*p, *p++ and *++p, if there is any. 
	++*p increments the value that p is pointing to and stores that new value at p. *p++
	Stores the value of p, then moves the pointer. I don't know what the last one does.
2. Is the left to right or right to left order guaranteed for operator precedence?
	Not neccesarily, it depends what operators are being used. If a postfix is being used
	then i's right to left, but otherwise it is right to left.
3. What are the advantages of using pointers? 
	Although shockingly, mind-bogglingly annoying, pointers can be helpful and more efficient
	when used with arrays for the purposes of returning arrays from functions or just
	managing arrays in general.
4. 
	4.1 "abc"		char name[]
	4.2 "xyz"[1] - ’y’	?
	4.3 ’\0’ == 0		0
	4.4 *a			10
	4.5 &a[0]		int
	4.6 *p			12
	4.7 &p			int
	4.8 *++argv		?
	4.9 &main		?
	4.10 sizeof(str)	int
