1. ++*p increments the value of the datatype located at pointer p and then points at that location. *p++ points at the location in memory of p and then increments the value there.  

2. The left to right order is guaranteed for operator precedence. 


3. One advantage of pointers is that you can move along a string and point to different parts of it.
